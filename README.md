# code-refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor the existing codebase for Horiseon's webpage so that it follows accessibility standards. Both the HTML and CSS are cleaner and have appropriate styling.
This makes the site optimized for search engines and will be easier to add additional code in the future.
